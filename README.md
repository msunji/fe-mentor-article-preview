## Overview

This is a pretty straightforward solution for an equally straightforward challenge. I took this opportunity to work with SCSS and plain ol' vanilla JavaScript. I find that working with frameworks has been really fun, but every so often, it's good to get back to the basics just to refresh your memory.

The project setup was pretty simple, and I used Gulp to compile SCSS to CSS, optimise assets like stylesheets and JS, and run [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/) to watch for changes in files.

For the project itself, it was mostly a good test of my understanding of CSS. I actually found the little pop-up bit with the icons to be a bit more difficult than I had initially anticipated.

## Built with
